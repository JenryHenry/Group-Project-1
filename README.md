Hungie Bois project
This website was designed with your hunger in mind! It uses your current location and your preferred choice of restaurant (Dine-In, Drive-Through, Sit Down, Carryout) and provides you with a curated selection that is presented to you 1-by-1! Why think when you can Yass or Pass?

Uses OpenWeather API, and Google Places API to populate tiles.
